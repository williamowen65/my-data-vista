Use Case:

At child care: Monitioring child behavior.   
    
UI: A canvas - This is where the data visualizations would be. 
- A form - adding a observation.  
  - Item name: (IN this use case the child name)  
  - tag: (You can create or reuse tags, and edit them)  
  - Description: A message about the observation  

UX: A user can access their account through Google, or okta,   
  - Question: "What are you observing?"  (Asked on first intro to site - They can add more later, but you need at least one.)    
     - User types a noun in singular form (for my use case, it would be child)   
     - Input Placeholder: (e.g., 'Child, Forest Fire, Musician')   
     - If they type "Children," suggest "Did you mean 'Child'?"     
       
  - They can start a new session (blank, based off another [include item name])
